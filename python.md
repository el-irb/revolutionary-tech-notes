# Python

## Install & Configuration

### Bootstrapping the `pip` installer

This might be needed when `pip` install was skipped when installing Python (or when creating a virtual env) or after explicitly uninstalling `pip`.

* Invoke CLI using `-m` switch: 
  
`python -m ensurepip`

* To upgrade the installed version of `pip`, pass the `--upgrade` option as: 
  
`python -m ensurepip --upgrade`
