# Improve on Software Engineering

## Domain, Architecture and Design

You need to know how things work in the front end (UI), the back end, the data store, the OS, any virtualization layers, the hardware, the network, and the data center.

Don't be a one-trick pony.

## Languages and Tools - From Noob to Intermediate

Read more code!

Go to meetups and grow your developer network to expand your experiences from interactions with them.

Don't be scared. Embrace the uncertainty of not knowing, because once you start, you will begin knowing.

Focus on programming techniques, problem solving and analytical skills, this will go along way more than knowing many languages.

Ask before you invent.

“[When reading high-quality code], it might be tempting to look for main() and start from there, but you're likely to spend a lot of time just reading set-up code and command-line parsing. I prefer to scan the filenames to look for some activity that interests me and then dig into those files. It's not crucial to understand the whole project or the ins and outs of the entire design, you'll wear yourself out doing this. Read the code. Look at the comments, see what the authors are doing, and how they went about it.” (Source)
—Andrew Binstock

Develop an aesthetic appreciation for code. Over time, you need to train yourself to know what great code looks like and what bad code “smells” like.

## Code Readibility & Maintainability

Don't ask permission to refactor. It's your job.

Fix what isn't broken. Optimize it.

Delete orphaned code.

Deep-nested code is harder to maintain, harder to reuse, and more likely to create bugs.

Write clear and effective comments as to self-document the code you write.

## Technical Debt, Code Coverage & Process

Know when to take on technical debt, and when to spend more time to clean up or optimize a solution.

QA and testing is required, the key is to maintain the right balance without slowing down deployments.

Ship often, fix less. Have better organizational practices, DevOps.

Think about security during any process you take throughout your code.

## Soft Skills & Productivity

Focus on coding without interreptuions. Deep work.

Communicate your problem solving process to your immediate team, not to prove that you're doing work, but that you could engage them and potentially learn a new perspective on your problem.

Share a wiki with your team.

Don't hide your lack of knowledge, it will only slow you down from getting shit done.

Don't be afraid to share your unfinished work with others.

Emotionally detach yourself from your code, it is not a baby to grow. It is a machine to polish.

Fail quick. Fail often. Win more.
