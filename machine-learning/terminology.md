# Terminology

**Machine Learning**: modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

**Model**: an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.

**Model Inference**: when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

**Model Training Algorithm**: an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

**Reinforcement Learning**: figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.

**Supervised Learning**: every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

**Unsupervised Learning**: uses no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
