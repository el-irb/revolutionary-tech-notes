Which of the following are the primary components used in machine learning?

* A machine learning model
* A model training algorithm
* A model inference algorithm

Think back to the clay teapot analogy. Is it true or false that you always need to have an idea of what you're making when you're handling your raw block of clay?

False

We introduced three common components of machine learning. Let's review your new knowledge by matching each component to its definition.

MACHINE LEARNING COMPONENT: DEFINITION

Machine learning model: generic program, made specific by data

Model training algorithm: an iterative process fitting a generic model to specific data

Model inference algorithm: process to use a trained model to solve a task
