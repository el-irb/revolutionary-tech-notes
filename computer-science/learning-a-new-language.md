# Learning a New Language

## 1 Review Documentation

It's not about learning all of the docs. Usually, perfectionists will want to do go through ALL of the docs. Don't. Instead, find out where to find more information on standard library and methods.

Follow the Paretto princile, about 80% of the outcome comes from 20% of the effort.

## 2 Learn the Baseline

Find the pattern between common core ideas:

1. Declaring variables and constants
2. Data types
3. Functions
4. Comments
5. Control flow
6. Data structures
7. Common methods for different data type manipulation, including but not limited to: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, etc.
8. RegExp

## 3 Use the Language REPL

REPL: read, evaluate, print, loop

This is a tool to quickly learn data types along with simple manipulation methods.

[Go language REPL site](https://repl.it/languages/go)

## 4 Practice Algorithms

Use online resources and coding tests from different available sites:

* hackerrank.com
* coderbyte.com
* exercism.io

## 5 Learn Testing

Learn and understand error handling so that you understand data types and their limitations.

## 6 Learn Package Management

Learn how to install and manage package dependencies.

Also recommended is to learn how to publish and distribute your own custom packages.

## 7 Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance

Practice, Practice, Practice, and follow the 5 Ps.

5 Ps: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance
