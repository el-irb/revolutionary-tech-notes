## Acronyms and Introduction

Human-centered design (HCD)

The total experience of a product covers much more than its usability:

- Aesthetics
- Fun
- Pleasure
- Enjoyment
- Emotion

Cost and schedule are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of multidisciplinary teams.

The best products do not always succeed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become accepted.

To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.

Based on psychology, on the nature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with the world, will remain unchanged.

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

2 of the most important characteristics of good design are:

- Discoverability: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
  - What does "it" do?
  - How does "it" work?
  - What operations are possible?
- Understanding: what does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

### The Complexity of Modern Devices

In the best cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction.

Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology.

It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology…So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.

### Human-Centered Design (HCD)

HCD is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving.

Good design:

- Starts with an understanding of psychology and technology
- Requires good communication, esp. from machine to person, indicating:
  - What actions are possible
  - What is happening
  - What is about to happen

Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned.

HCD is a **design philosophy**. It means starting with a good understanding of ppl and the needs that the design is intended to meet. This comes through observation, for ppl themselves are often unaware of their true needs, even unaware of the difficulties they are facing.

HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations.

### Fundamental Principles of Interaction

**Discoverability** results from appropriate application of 5 fundamental psychological concepts:

- Affordances
- Signifiers
- Constraints
- Mappings
- Feedback
- Conceptual model of the system (provides true understanding)

#### Affordances

**Affordances** make sense for interaction with physical objects. Affordance refers to the _relationship_ between a physical object and a person (or any interacting agent, animal, machines, robots, etc.). An affordance is a _relationship_ between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.

The presence of an affordance is jointly determined by the qualities of the object and the abilities of the agent that is interacting. This relational definition of affordance gives considerable difficulty to many ppl.

Affordance IS NOT a property, it is a _relationship_.

An **anti-affordance** is the prevention of interaction.

To be effective, affordances and anti-affordances have to be _discoverable_ or perceivable. If they can't be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: a **signifier**.

Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical: visible affordances provide strong clues to the operations of things. Perceived affordances help ppl figure out what actions are possible without the need for labels or instructions.

##### Fun Fact

Affordances was a term coined by the insights of J.J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many advances to our understanding of human perception.

In _Gibsonian psychology_, an ecological approach to perception is taken, meaning the world contains the clues and the ppl simply pick them up through "direct perception".

Combined info, "information pickup", picked up by all of our sensory apparatus - sight, sound, smell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position - determines our perceptions without the need for internal processing or cognition.

#### Signifiers

**Signifiers** specify how people discover those possibilities.

**Signifiers** are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. **Signifiers** are of far more importance to designers than are **affordances**.

## Chapter 2

Different emotions arise at different stages, and show which stages are primarily located at each of the three levels of processing:

- Visceral: for the elementary levels of motor action performance and perception
- Behavioral: for the levels of action specification and initial interpretation of the outcome
- Reflective: for the development of goals, plans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome

## Chapter 3

Culture

## Chapter 5

Best new approach to deal with design to either eliminate or minimize human error: **resilience engineering**.

## Chapter 6

**Norman’s Law**: the day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.

## Chapter 7

Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is, most radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it can take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innovation, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.
