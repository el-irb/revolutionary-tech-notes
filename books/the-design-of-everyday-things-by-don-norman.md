## Acronyms and Introduction

Human-centered design (HCD)

The total experience of a product covers much more than its usability:

- Aesthetics
- Fun
- Pleasure
- Enjoyment
- Emotion

Cost and schedule are critical, the need to pay attention to competition, and the importance of multidisciplinary teams.

The best products do not always succeed. Brilliant new technologies might take decades to become accepted.

To understand products, it is not enough to understand design or technology: it is critical to understand business.

Based on psychology, on the nature of human cognition, emotion, action, and interaction with the world, will remain unchanged.

## Chapter 1: The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

2 of the most important characteristics of good design are:

- Discoverability: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
- Understanding: what does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls and settings mean?

### The Complexity of Modern Devices

In the best cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable, which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied, but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of interaction.

Design is concerned with how things work, how they are controlled, and the nature of the interaction between people and technology.

It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

Design presents a fascinating interplay of technology and psychology…So we must design our machines on the assumption that people will make errors.

**Affordances** make sense for interaction with physical objects.

**Signifiers** specify how people discover those possibilities.

**Signifiers** are signs, perceptible signals of what can be done. **Signifiers** are of far more importance to designers than are **affordances**.

## Chapter 2

Different emotions arise at different stages, and show which stages are primarily located at each of the three levels of processing:

- Visceral: for the elementary levels of motor action performance and perception
- Behavioral: for the levels of action specification and initial interpretation of the outcome
- Reflective: for the development of goals, plans, and the final stage of evaluation of the outcome

## Chapter 3

Culture

## Chapter 5

Best new approach to deal with design to either eliminate or minimize human error: **resilience engineering**.

## Chapter 6

**Norman’s Law**: the day the product team is announced, it is behind schedule and over its budget.

## Chapter 7

Everyone wants radical innovation, but the truth is, most radical innovations fail, and even when they do succeed, it can take multiple decades before they are accepted. Radical innovation, therefore, is relatively rare: incremental innovation is common.
