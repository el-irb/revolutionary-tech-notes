# Value Stream Management

Value Stream Management (VSM) is known as the factory model to analyze:

* Information flow
* Material flow, AKA DevOPs flow
* Time flow

Information flows from customer to your service to your supplier down to your proccesses in your material flow or DevOps flow. The information content can be thought of as "feature requests", "bug fixes", or any label that fits your proccesses.

The unity of the three inputs give an agile DevOps structure:

From the info flow into the DevOps flow, it can vary from company to company, but the main categories in a software developer company are:

* Feature request
* Analysis
* Approval
* Definition/design
* Coding
* Testing/validation
* Deployment

An example can be seen below:
