# Behavioral Interview Prep

In a behavioral interview, an interviewer is looking for demonstrated evidence of my skill, not just a statement of skill.

Interviewers listen to my stories to evaluate if I have the skills and experience to succeed in the role. They want to know how I've handled situations in the past, and how I will handle them in the future.

The trick to a behavioral interview is to prepare stories ahead of time. These stories need to be consistent with my brand statement, so that the interviewer can have a coherent vision of my strengths, skills, and experiences.

## Develop Brand Statement (Elevator Pitch)

A brand statement is a concise statement that describes who I am, what I do, and what I can provide to a company. It should be consistent with my resume, my LinkedIn profile, and my cover letter.

This is usually the answer to the question "tell me about yourself".

## Prep Stories for the Behavioral Interview using STAR Method

Develop specific stories that bring my brand statement to life. Pick 2-3 stories that demonstrate my skills and experiences, and show how I can provide value to the company.

These stories should be structured using the STAR method:

- **Situation**: Describe the situation I was in, paint a vivid picture to create clear understanding
- **Task**: Describe the task I needed to accomplish, be specific and provide details
- **Action**: Describe the actions I took to accomplish the task, use "I" statements to highlight my contributions
- **Result**: Describe the result of my actions, focus on positive outcomes, share what I learned, and quantify the results if possible

When talking about technical projects, do not dive into the specs right away. Take a breather, and use the STAR method. Describe the situation, the task, the actions, and the results.
