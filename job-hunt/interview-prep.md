## General Interview Tips

Reflect the 4 C's: calm, cool, collected, and confident. I know I can do the job, make sure the interviewer knows it too.

Practice good non-verval communication, such as standing-up straight, making eye contact, and smiling.

Watch their body language, and make sure I'm not losing them.

Match their conversational style, if they're formal, be formal, if they're casual, be casual.

Don't be too familiar. Keep it professional.

Take time to answer questions, don't rush. It's ok to say "great question, let me think about that for a moment".

Verbalize your thoughts, thinking out loud is okay. Restate the question. Ask clarifying questions. Show your work!

Listen to the interviewer, and help them during the quest to find out how I can provide value to their team.

Treat the interview as a conversation, not an interrogation.

Interviewers are not looking for the most perfect solution, they're looking for how I think, break down a problem, get to a solution, and communicate my thought process.

During a technical interview, it's okay to ask for help, or ask for a hint. It's okay to say "I don't know" or "I'm not sure". It's okay to ask for clarification.

When solving a problem, think critically about the algorithmic complexity of the solution.
Analyze and explain the time and space complexity of the solution.
