# Ruby

3 data types:

- Numbers
- Booleans
- Strings
  - Use quotation marks only for strings (' ' or " ")

Keywords:

- `print` = takes user's input and prints it to the screen
- `puts` = adds a new blank line after the printed data
- `.length` = returns the length of a string
  - Useful to check and make sure a credit card number appears to be valid
- `.reverse` = prints the backwards version of a string
  - Useful if you want to sort out a list of values from highest to lowest instead of lowest to highest
- `.upcase` = converts string to all uppercase
- `.downcase` = coverts string to all lowercase
- `.capitalize` = uppercase for the first letter in a string
- `#` sign is for comments that Ruby won't interpret as code
- `=` = multi-line comments that begin and end with an equal sign
- `chomp` = removes extra blank lines
- `gets` = gets input from user

Some rules:

- Ruby is case-sensitive
- Local variables could be declared with a lowercase and words should be separated with underscores:
  - Examples: `counter`, `masterful_method`
- `if` code block following an `if` statement should be indented 2x
