# Project Management

## Step 1 - Project Analysis

### Requirements

Synonyms: problems, tasks, deliverables

Whatever the requirements, make sure to understand the concept behind it to address it properly.

Not all of the requirements are picture perfect. Most of them can be clear as mud. **Make sure to ask questions**. Ask ANYONE to find answers!

Don't overformalize this process. The point here is to help everyone be on the same page, as to the problem and the potential solution. No red-tape, and make sure there is a **systematic plan** to address any problems.

Seek to understand what you've been asked to do, AKA the requirements. **Identify all of your tasks, and think through all consequences of implementation**.

### Classify the tasks

What type of work will the tasks require? Some examples below:

- Bug fixes
- New features
- New application
- Research assignment
- Performance improvement

Shorten the tasks into 1 or 2 simple sentences. Summarize the complex requirements into no more than 3 simple sentences.

If you can't summarize the tasks, then you need to break it down into more tasks. This is a litmus test to make sure tasks are classified into small enough chunks.

### Outline the major parts

Use [Quire.io](http://Quire.io) to make a list of the major things that need to be completed, and assign them a phase 1, sprint 1, iteration 1, etc. Any labeling works, but keep it simple.

Simple summaries of every major step in the descriptions.

This list should not be a step-by-step guide, but an analysis of the tasks required.

Then create child nodes for the major parts with specific, smaller tasks.

### Define the requirement in the smaller tasks

Use these questions to define the tasks:

- Why will someone use this?
- What real world problem am I trying to fix?

If the answers are not obvious, ask someone that might know, see [Requirements](#Requirements).

A deeper understanding of the requirements and purpose will serve to make decisions in software development that will truly serve the client.

## Step 2 - Interpretation and application

### Evaluating requirements

Ask yourself these questions:

- What am I doing?
- How am I expected to do it?
- Why am I doing it that way?

Clarify important terms related to the requirements.

Identify and define all important terminology.

### Identify how the tasks will be done

This is how you will be doing your work, step by step guide, or some type of documentation to record your work.

DO IT!

### Determine if the requirements were met

Ask yourself:

- Were the requirements met?
- Do the requirements translate to the UI correctly?
- Will this outcome solve the original problem?

### Think critically

Make sure that you understand the problem and the solution to speak up when there are questions about the development.

If you can't confidently state the problem and the implemented solution, you should check your work.

If there is a solution that was not deployed and cannot be described at that point in time, say so and ask for more time to decide on the future solutions. To be uninformed is not an insult, but instead it means that information was lacking when a solution was created.

A solution being incomplete may actually be intended, a minimum viable product (MVP). MVPs leave out functionality at first in purpose. This will dedicate more resources to the important features of the application, and build upon that.
