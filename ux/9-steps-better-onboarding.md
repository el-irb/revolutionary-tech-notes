# 9 Steps to Better User Onboarding

Onboarding is the management of the early stages of relationship between a business and a customer.

## 1 State

Wishful thinking for a developer is to have a full state for user, with all data filled; however, that is not reality. For new users, it is an empty state.

Always think of empty states.

## 2 Flow

What does the user see from an empty space to the awesome space?

The onboarding journey starts with the user realizing they feel something or thinking something, and it goes from:

**Homepage** -> **Empty state** -> **Awesome state**

Think about how the user gets to your homepage, which users might not always be happy or love your application. They might have just gotten fired from their job and are feeling blue, they might have just broken up with their boyfriend/girlfriend and are feeling sad, go deeper into that user's motivation that drove him/her to your application.

## 3 Reduce the number of steps

Get to the WOW factor/awesome state as soon as possible.

Each step is literally a hurdle, so one or two are ideal...or make each step like a lateral funnel with optional steps with smaller and smaller requirements through the funnel.

A good idea is to have a layover on top of the ACTUAL application to tease the user to complete the few steps to create an account.

## 4 Set sensible defaults

Every option the user gets makes him/her think about the option to decide whether to switch a toggle or click on a checkbox to add an item or task to the onboarding step.

## 5 Gamify

Incentivize users and make it fun for them to onboard.


** Tip: people love checklists (dopamine fiends)

## 6 Emails

Onboarding happens on different platforms, not just on your app. Email is another platform. They're integral of the onboarding process.

** Tip: make emails relevant, don't send too many and deliver happiness.

** Tip: don't be patronizing or begging in your email content

## 7 Mobile

Think of mobile layout design.

## 8 Sign-up

Sign-up for your own product to find flaws, gaps and bottlenecks. Test and test to find the holes!

** Tip: get a third-party to do this and provide feedback

## 9 Measure

Measure onboarding success, conversion rate, and other KPIs.

What makes the awesome state for other users? Give it to new users right away.

What does the user before, during and after onboarding?

## Extra Cohort analysis

Break down things by cohort.
