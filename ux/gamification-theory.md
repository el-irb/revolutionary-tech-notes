# Gamification Theory

Gamification is the craft of finding all the fun and engaging elements from games and applying them to user interfaces (UI).

Places emphasis on human motivation, as in human-focused design VS function-focused design.

Human-focused design remembers that people in a system have:
- Feelings
- Insecurities
- Reasons to do things
- Reasons to not do things

Tailoring to the needs above will optimize their feelings, motivations and engagement with the system.

There are different core drivers for human-focused design, each of them work differently from an inspiring and motivating way to a manipulative and obsessive manner. Hence, the gamification framework called **Octalysis**, an octagon shape with 8 core drivers.

## Octalysis' 8 core drivers

1. Epic meaning & calling: the "chosen one" effect
  - Narrative
  - Elitism
  - Humanity hero
  - Revealed heart
  - Beginner's luck
  - Innate talent/gifted
  - Free lunch
  - Cap switcher
  - Co-creationist
2. Accomplishment & development: a badge or trophy w/out a "challenge" means nothing at all
  - Status points
  - Badges (achievement symbols)
  - Fixed action rewards (earned lunch)
  - Leaderboard
  - Progress bar
  - Quest lists
  - Dessert oasis
  - High five
  - Crowning
  - Anticipation parade
  - Aura effect
  - Step-by-step overlay tutorial
  - Boss fights
3. Empowerment of creativity & feedback: creative discoverers need immediate feedback to stay engaged
  - Milestone unlocks
  - Real-time control
  - Chain combos
  - Dynamic feedback
  - Boosters
  - Blank fills
  - Plant pickers
  - Poison pickers
  - Attribute web chart
  - Double-edged sword
4. Ownership & possession: accumulate wealth or get rewarded for the time invested as ownership, i.e. Avatar customization
  - Exchangeable points
  - Virtual goods
  - Build from scratch
  - Alfred effect?
  - Collection sets
  - Avatar
  - Protector quest
  - Pet companion
  - Observer attachment
5. Social influence & relatedness: the drive we have to draw closer to people, places, events or things to relate to with others
  - Friending
  - Social treasure/gifting
  - See-saw bump
  - Group quests
  - Trophy shelf
  - Brag button
  - Water cooler
  - Conformity anchors
  - Mentorship
  - Social prod
6. Scarcity & impatience: the drive of wanting something bc you CANNOT have it
  - Appointment dynamics (come back later to get reward)
  - Magnetic caps
  - Dangling
  - Prize pacing
  - Bootleg quest
  - Last mile drive
  - Countdown timer
  - Torture breaks
  - Moats
  - The big burn?
7. Unpredictability & curiosity: "what will happen next" effect
  - Glowing choice
  - Mini-quests
  - Visual storytelling
  - Easter eggs
  - Random rewards
  - Obvious wonder
  - Rolling rewards
  - Evolved UI
  - Sudden rewards
  - Oracle effect
  - Gambling
  - Sweepstakes/lotteries
  - Skinner Box experiments
8. Avoidance & loss: "act now or forever live in regret" effect
  - Sunk cost prison
  - Progress loss
  - Rightful heritage
  - Evanescence opportunity
  - Status quo sloth
  - Streaking
  - Evil egg
  - FOMO punch
9. Sensation** (hidden core driver)

## Left (extrinsic, logical) vs right (intrinsic, emotional) brain core drivers

Extrinsic motivators: motivated to obtain something resulting in a reward
- Works at first, but users tend to decline in engagement

Intrinsic motivators: the activity itself is rewarding on its own
- Better long term motivators

The right brain core drivers include:
- Creativity
- Self-expression
- Social aspects

The left brain core drivers include:
- Logic
- Calculations
- Ownership

** Not a true neuroscience, but the framework is easier to design with divisions between logical and emotional drivers

## White-hat vs black-hat gamification

Top core drivers are considered as positive motivators, hence "white-hat":
- Feel good and powerful
- Express creativity
- Skill mastery
- Higher sense of meaning or purpose

Bottom core drivers are considered negative, hence "black-hat":
- Don't know what will happen next
- Fear of losing something
- Fear of not getting something
- Leaves a bad taste in your mouth

** Black-hat doesn't mean always bad, as it can be used to go to the gym more often, eat healthier, or avoid hitting the snooze button e/AM

## Higher levels of octalysis

The above gamification theory details is covered in "Level 1 Octalysis", however, there are up to 5 levels.

### Level 2: design for all 4 phases

Level 2 consists of optimizing the UX throughout all four phases in a user's journey:
1. Discovery: why is the user starting the journey?
2. Onboarding: how do you guide/teach users through the application?
3. Scaffolding: how do you win/master the application?
4. Endgame: how do you retain your users?

### Level 3: factor in user types (Bartle's player types)

See how different people are motivated at different stages of the experience by creating a matrix. On the x-axis, line up the 4 phases from level2, and on the y-axis from bottom to top:
1. Achievers
2. Explorers
3. Socializers
4. Killers

## Master gamification theory

Gamification theory application is not that easy. It's a craft that requires a lot of analysis, thinking, testing and adjusting.

"If the world adopts good gamification principles and focus on what truly drives fun and motivation, then it is possible to see a day where there is no longer a divide between things people must do and the things they want to do." Play all day!
