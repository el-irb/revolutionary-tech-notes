## The Need For Continuous Integration

Software development process sometimes is seen as the process that is modernizing the world, but in essence, software devs look at Henry Ford’s assembly line to figure out the CI/CD pipelines, agile and Kansan all come from Toyota Corp mgmt studies…Do not undermine the efforts made by the software world to improve the efficiency, but be more humble when we look at the world and think that we are the ones who are modernizing the world.

Reliability is the most important feature of a software.

## What Is Continuous Integration

Simple testing can prevent most critical failures.

Continuous Integration is a process of ensuring that every change that gets integrated into a repository goes through various checks, that we are confident about its reliability.

Desired features of a CI tool:

- Ability to create jobs to run build, tests, packaging, etc. by integrating various tools
- Connect those jobs to create a sequence of execution pipelines
- Run these pipelines in an automated way
- Ability to trigger these pipelines based on external events, e.g. pushing code to git repo

## Continuous Delivery VS Continuous Deployment

There is a difference between the Ds, CDelivery is when there is a “manager” stopping the automated deployment to a production environment to give the thumbs up to push to production. CDeployment is when there is no human intervention between the CI and the deployment to the production environment, meaning no human in between jobs and production environment deployments.

## How to CI/CD?

1. Agile: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery requires an agile approach with smaller batches of features to create features faster.
2. Build: should be automated and should be quick to compile app
3. Tests: should be automated and should cover most unit testing
   - There is an approach called the “test pyramid” which states that the farther along you are in the following test stages, the longer it takes to test:
        1. Unit tests
        2. Component tests
        3. Service tests
        4. API tests
        5. UI tests
        6. Exploratory tests
4. Deployment: should be automated

### Best practices

- Revision control: keep all configuration, build files, deployment logic, etc. in a repository to allow revision control while changes are being integrated
- Development workflows: using tools like Git and Github or Gitlab
- Code review: always have an extra pair of eyes before integrating changes

## Continuous Delivery

- Setup revision control system
- Define development workflow and code reviews
- Setup CI platform
- Create CI pipelines - Build, Test, etc.
- Build and manage artifacts - packaging jobs
- Setup deployment tools
- Create deployment pipelines

## Docker

Leverage docker to improve your CI/CD.
