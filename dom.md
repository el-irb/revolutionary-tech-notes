# Document Object Model (DOM)

The DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.

- The DOM represents the documents as nodes and objects, that way programming languages can connect to the page
- A web page is a document
  - The DOM represents that same document in the browser window and HTML source so it can be manipulated
